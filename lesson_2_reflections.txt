What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a hidden file named .git.  This files, more or less, keep track of all history changes or commits made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging are is a temporary place to place your pending committed files.  While working directories are just a normal local directory and repositories are directories that are tracked by github.
